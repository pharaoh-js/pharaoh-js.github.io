    <h1>Pharaoh</h1>
    <p>We're a group of students at <a href="http://devmounta.in">DevMountain</a>, building just about the neatest
      instructor tool you've ever seen. Imagine a lecture with no JSBin or JSFiddle, with no opening the Developer Tools
      in your browser just to show something in the console, with no rushed projects thrown together and then sent out
      on Slack. Imagine a read-only app that would allow students to see your code in realtime, as you make changes, and
      see everything you `import` or `require`, and check out the files you're pulling from.</p>
    <p>Well, that's what we imagined, because right now there's a <em>ton</em> of tooling around Javascript
      development, but not nearly enough <em>tools</em> for teaching it. We're starting with a React-based student
      app and a package for one of the most popular editors on the market. We hope to build this into something pretty
      awesome, because no one should have to use JSBin, Github, and Slack, just to get through one lecture.</p>
    <p>For now, please check out <a href="https://github.com/Pharaoh-JS">our code</a>. PRs welcome.</p>
